Documentation for the diceplot package
=======================================

**Note for R users:** This documentation now highlights `ggdiceplot <https://github.com/maflot/ggdiceplot>`_ 
as the recommended R package for creating dice plots. ggdiceplot is fully ggplot2-native and offers more 
flexibility and features than the legacy DicePlot package.

The diceplot package allows you to create visualizations (diceplots) for datasets with more than two categorical variables and additional continuous variables. This tool is particularly useful for exploring complex categorical data and their relationships with continuous variables.
