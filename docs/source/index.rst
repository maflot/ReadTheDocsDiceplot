   :alt: Diceplot aims to bridge the gap between high- and low-level visualizations of your data.

Displaying multidimensional categorical data often poses a challenge in life sciences to get a comprehensive overview of
the underlying data. This is not limited to but holds in particular for pathway analysis across multiple conditions. Here
we developed a visualization concept to create easy to understand and intuitive representation of such data. We provide
the implementation as python as well as R package to ensure easy access and application.


Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Visualize Complex Data:** Easily create plots for datasets with multiple categorical variables.
- **Dice Plot:** Create dice plots for datasets with more than two categorical variables.
- **Dominoplot:** Visualize gene expression data for different cell types and contrasts.
- **R and python**: Implementations in both R and python to ensure easy access and application.
- **Customization:** Customize plots with titles, labels, and themes.
- **Integration with ggplot2:** Leverages the power of ``ggplot2`` for advanced plotting capabilities.
- **Interactive Plots:** Create interactive plots for easy exploration of your data using the plotly backend.
